The Philips Hue wall module can be a hassle to use it as a dimmer when using a wall pushbutton switch. 
This blueprint helps to get this fairly easy working.

Note:

- You must use the wall module together with the Zigbee integration (ZHA)
- RDM001 module is supported.
- Make sure to configure the correct model depending on the type of button(s) you use. More information on how this is done can be found
